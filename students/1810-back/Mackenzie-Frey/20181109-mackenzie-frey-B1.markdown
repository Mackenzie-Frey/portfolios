# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

  This module, I was determined to grow and feel confident as a developer. I was determined to go from struggling to understand the concepts to fluency and feeling flow states while coding. I was successful!

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

  I struggled the most with the projects. It was challenging for me to take a large problem and understand how all the pieces would interact. I overcame this problem by focusing on chunking the tasks and doing the task I was able to do at that moment, even if it was tiny. I now feel significantly more confident in my ability to problem solve.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

  My favorite project was enigma because I could see how much I had grown during the module.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

  I learned about my working style, during an independent project, and how I like to work solo until I come to code that is beyond my current ability to create, at which point I like to work side by side with someone and talk through the next steps.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

  I learned the importance of being direct with people I ask questions of when I need more succinct guidance. I also learned the importance of insuring my goal, for the project, is learning, rather than project completion. From the group project, I learned how to facilitate a learning experience for myself when other group members produce code at a faster rate and prefer to work independently.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

  I make an effort each morning and evening to say hello and good bye to my peers. I reach out to those of whom I see signs of them facing challenges. I give what is mine to give. I've reached out to the 1811 BE cohort and invited them to events.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

  I would like to be a resource for the 1811 BE cohort.
